## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Please provide the following:

Empowering producers of Geographical Indications (GI) with blockchain-based traceability and sustainability tools.

Geopedi is a blockchain-based platform designed to support producers of Geographical Indications (GI) by providing transparency, sustainability certification, and consumer trust through digital records. By leveraging blockchain, it aims to create immutable proof of origin and authenticity, fostering consumer trust and helping producers differentiate their products in competitive markets.

Geopedi integrates with the Substrate framework to create a decentralized, scalable, and secure infrastructure for GI product traceability. The platform leverages the decentralized nature of Polkadot to ensure data integrity and transparency across multiple sectors and regions.

The team is passionate about enhancing the value and recognition of GI producers, At Geopedi, we are proud to have partnered with TOBB (The Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey) to strengthen our mission of empowering GI producers. For the past two years, we have been maturing this idea, and we’ve recently applied for a patent to protect our innovative approach. Through blockchain, Geopedi offers a sustainable and forward-thinking solution to combat fraud and ensure traceability, allowing GI products to compete globally. 🌍💪

### Project Details


The platform’s user interface will be simple, user-friendly, and mobile-responsive to cater to non-technical users. We will include a digital dashboard for producers to upload data, track supply chains, and monitor GI certifications.
Blockchain will be used to record product data, ensuring transparency and authenticity via smart contracts, with APIs for third-party interaction. 
Substrate (for blockchain layer), Polkadot (cross-chain functionality), Smart Contracts, RESTful APIs, front-end in React.js.
The technology stack includes Substrate for the blockchain, Polkadot for cross-chain functionality, React.js for the front-end, and RESTful APIs. 
A PoC has been developed for Turkish regional products, though regulatory and auditing services will be handled by external certified bodies.

Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):

- The (future) tokenomics of your project
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

Fit in the Ecosystem: Geopedi fits within the Polkadot ecosystem as a decentralized application (dApp) focused on transparency, sustainability, and trust for GI producers and consumers.
Target Audience: GI producers, supply chain auditors, sustainability certification bodies, blockchain enthusiasts, regulators.
Needs Addressed: Geopedi addresses the need for transparent and traceable supply chains in the agricultural and food production sectors, particularly for GI products, which are prone to fraud and lack robust certification mechanisms.
Identification of Needs: The team identified this need through extensive consultations with GI producers in Turkey, as well as research into challenges faced by agricultural sectors worldwide.
Similar Projects: There are other traceability platforms like Provenance and OriginTrail, but Geopedi is unique in focusing exclusively on GI products and integrating advanced sustainability metrics into its blockchain system.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables are based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish *under the terms of the license* of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Projects that submit other people's work without proper attribution will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested.
- **DOT %:** Percentage of Total Costs to be paid in (vested) DOT (≥ 50%)

The long-term vision includes scaling the platform to support millions of transactions, integrating it with international auditing bodies, and enhancing the platform's sustainability impact through machine learning and data analytics.



## Future Plans

We aims to expand globally by engaging with prominent international organizations like TOBB, emphasizing both ongoing patent applications and blockchain innovations. The platform plans to scale its operations to support millions of transactions, integrating with international auditing bodies for GI product certifications. Additionally, Geopedi will enhance its platform by leveraging machine learning and data analytics to maximize sustainability impacts, while continuously building partnerships with influential global firms to strengthen its position in the market.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

We will continue expanding our knowledge, increase the pace for the idea and the project we work on.
